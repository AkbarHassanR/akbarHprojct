				<p>Located in the north of Iraq, nestled between Iran and Turkey, Iraqi Kurdistan is today a safe but turbulent region, home to some of the most breathtaking landscape in the Middle East, composed of green mountains with snow-capped peaks that, deﬁnitely, will break with all the stereotypes you have about Iraq.
               Iraqi Kurdistan is no desert and, most importantly, it is not a war zone ﬁlled with ISIS terrorists but an autonomous region which, for the last couple of years, has done a tremendous job defending its borders.
              Kurdistan is very safe and the most ultimate destination for travelers looking for something unique, very off the beaten track, and who are willing to meet the Kurds, a very proud and brave nation, who turn out to also be some of the most hospitable people I have ever encountered, with similar experiences to Iran, Pakistan, and Sudan.
             From visiting refugee camps to crazy stories involving the Peshmerga military, great hitchhiking and camping experiences and just amazing people with unbelievable stories to tell, Kurdistan may be the high</p>

 		<p>When to visit Iraqi Kurdistan –Spring and fall are the ideal months to travel, when the temperatures are mild. Winters are surprisingly cold, even in Erbil, and summers are hot. However, the weather is never really extreme, so I would say that Kurdistan is a year-round destination.
