 		<h1> A few quick tips before traveling to Kurdistan
</h1>
 		<p class="a">5 – The other countries though, need to go through a very tedious process –For people of other nationalities, getting a visa can be a difﬁcult and expensive process. I suggest you contact your nearest Iraqi Embassy or email the KRG Representation at dfr@krg.org.</p>

<p class="a">6 – Iraqi Kurdistan visas can’t be used to visit the Arab Iraq – This is important. A valid visa for traveling to Iraqi Kurdistan doesn’t allow you to visit outside of Kurdistan, that is to enter actual Iraq. If you try to enter, you will just bump into very strict military control who will send you back home. Just to clarify, because many people ask me, this also includes Mosul. You can’t go to Mosul with a Kurdistan visa.

<p class="a">7 – Don’t get any regular travel insurance – Iraqi Kurdistan is no normal destination and, most likely, it is a country that your Government advises against all travel to, so most travel insurance companies will not offer coverage for Iraq. </p>
<p class="a">8 – One of the very few which does isIATI Insurance – I recommend it for the following reasons:
It provides coverage to a big bunch of adventurous destinations which other don’t, like Iraq, Syria or Sudan
It has loads of different plans at very competitive prices

Tours for traveling to Iraqi Kurdistan
Iraqi Kurdistan is not an easy destination, so many people decide to travel there on a tour, which is perfectly all right.
There are, of course, many tour guides out there but I strongly recommend Karwan from Iraqi Kurdistan Tours.
Karwan is an independent tour guide who, in the last few years, he has become a real legend in the region. He is very knowledgeable about the region and, if you make a bit of online research, you will see that all travelers have been really happy with him, so I can’t
recommend him enough.
In addition, the readers of this blog can get an exclusive 5% discount to the ﬁnal quote by using my code ATC-KURD
Just email him at karwan.wahed@gmail.com and mention Against the Compass plus the discount code somewhere in the subject or the body text.

<p class="a"> 9 – Flying in – Kurdistan has two international airports: Erbil and Suleymaniyah and, most likely, you will be flying to Erbil. Pegasus (via Istanbul) and Fly Dubai (via Dubai) are the cheapest and most common routes.
10 – Entering by land – You can enter Kurdistan from either Iran or Turkey. The Iranian side is very easy and straightforward but the Turkish authorities will give you a lot of trouble.</p>
